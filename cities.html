        <strong><li>New York</li></strong>
        <em><li>Las Vegas</li></em>
        <strong><li>Tokyo</li></strong>
      </ol>
      <p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; color:green">I would like to visit New York city because im from a small town and have always wanted to see some of the landmarks there. I have a friend who lives in Las Vegas and she has asked us to come out to party with her. Lastly, I enjoy Anime and think it would be fun to go to the Anime district in Tokyo.</p>
