      <p>I lived in Woodruff because that is where my parents raised me. My grandparents lived in Duncan and we lived with them for a brief time. My first duty station in the military was in Warner Robins till I received orders to Aurora.</p>
      <h1>Top three cities I would like to visit</h1>
      <ol>
        <strong><li>New York</li></strong>
        <em><li>Las Vegas</li></em>
        <strong><li>Tokyo</li></strong>
      </ol>
      <p>I would like to visit New York city because im from a small town and have always wanted to see some of the landmarks there. I have a friend who lives in Las Vegas and she has asked us to come out to party with her. Lastly, I enjoy Anime and think it would be fun to go to the Anime district in Tokyo.</p>
